# **VinBigData-Abnormalities-Detection**
This directory contains all information and code related to preprocessing the original dataset into the input for our models.

Resized dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/discussion/207955

Method for removing overlapping bounding boxes: NMS or WBF.

Then we split into k-folds (k = 5).

Finally, we convert into one of two formats: COCO and YOLO.
